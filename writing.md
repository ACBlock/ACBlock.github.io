### Cold Nights at the Observatory
This is a short story that I wrote while in college, based on spending time at my school's observatory. While I never encountered anything supernatural myself, it was a creepy place in the dead of night.
This doesn't reflect my full abilities as a writer and I will be updating it as I have time.
