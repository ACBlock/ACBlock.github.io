My plans for this site are fairly simple. I'll be using it to document my professional growth, to be as succint as possible. I really enjoy physics and programming, but I have lost my way a bit. My actual plan then, is simple: As I have time, I'll be tackling a physics problem (proably moslty undergraduate level) that I think is interesting. I'll work through my thinking, show my work, and include some code I use to make it all come together. I hope you'll join me for some of these problems and at the end, maybe we'll all be slightly more intelligent than we were at the start.
