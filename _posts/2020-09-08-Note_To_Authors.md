In this course of uploading physics problems and code to this site, I will likely be pulling from existing textbooks for problems. Therefore, I recognize that I will be making what amounts to a sort of solution manual for various physics textbooks.

This presents an issue to physics teachers because they do not want their students simply copying code and derivations from the internet to complete their homework. I have a couple of responses to this.

\begin{itemize}
	\item This is a small personal website that I expect no one to see. 
	\item Students really should not copy code from a guy whose most recent job is as a security guard at Target.
	\item In practice, I will likely not be able to go through so many questions from a single textbook that this website serves as anything resembling a quality compendium of physics knowledge.
\end{itemize}

That said: If any authors find this site and would like certain posts removed, contact me using one of the links at the bottom of the webpage and I will be sure to do so.
